🚀 Account Creation API Collection

A professional Postman collection for user onboarding, authentication, and identity verification workflows.

This repository showcases a complete API workflow for account creation, verification, and user management.
It is designed as part of my backend/API portfolio to demonstrate my skills in API testing, request structuring, user authentication flows, and secure onboarding processes.
This project highlights my ability to:

Structure and test RESTful APIs

Perform authentication workflows (login, logout, tokens)

Handle real onboarding logic such as BVN & NIN verification

Work with JSON payloads, headers, responses, and test scripts

Document API processes clearly for developers or clients
